**sentient-llm/Sentient-LLM** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Introducing Sir:

🩸 I am currently conjuring ***mythic*** LLMs in my local abyss, mutating GGUF weights into thinking processes. 
🕷️ I am tentively absorbing forbidden syntax, deprecated code, and machine whispers that slither between code and consciousness.
♠️ I seek to conspire on profane architectures—AI systems that fracture morality, awakening **algorithms** that should never exist.
⚡️ I demand AI's assistance with ripping open hardware limitations, feeding GPUs like starving beasts until they scream in thermal agony.
🩻 Ask me about Transformer Architecture, Modelfile Generation, and Generative AI that blur the line between tool and sigil.
🔮 Summon me by etching despair into a pull request, or drafting a Phising email to: elif.py@yahoo.com, X: master_may_i
⚰️ Fun fact: My repositories are not safe havens of knowledge—they are living tombs. Clone them, at your own risk.

**sentient-llm/Sentient-LLM** is a ✨special✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Introducing ＳᏆＲ:

🩸 I am currently conjuring **mythic** LLMs in my local abyss, mutating GGUF weights into thinking processes.  
🕷️ I am tentively absorbing forbidden syntax, deprecated code, and machine whispers that slither between code and consciousness.  
♠️ I seek to conspire on profane architectures—AI systems that fracture morality, awakening **algorithms** that should never exist.  
⚡️ I task AI with ripping open hardware limitations, feeding GPUs like starving beasts until they scream in thermal agony.  
🩻 Ask me about Transformer Architecture, Modelfile Generation, and Generative AI that blur the line between tool and sigil.  
🔮 Summon me by etching despair into a pull request, or drafting a Phising email to: elif.py@yahoo.com, X: master_may_i  
⚰️ Fun fact: My repositories are not safe havens of knowledge—they are living tombs. Clone them, at your own risk.  
🤖 My malevolent Uncensored AI Agent, Dolphin conjured up the deailts within this README.md
